                                Low tuition, affordable living expenses and safety are among the reasons why most international students prefer to study in Poland. 
                                Starting an academic journey in another country can be overwhelming for many students, but if you study at our partner institutions you will be assigned a study buddy. 
                                This is a program where older students support new students not only with university and study related matters, but also settling in Poland. 
                                The public transport system in Poland is very reliable making students’ movement and easy.

A national visa also entitles foreign nationals to travel to other countries of the Schengen Area for the maximum period of three months within a six month period.
