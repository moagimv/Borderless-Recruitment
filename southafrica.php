                                As one of the countries offering best tertiary education in Africa, South Africa is still regarded as one of the affordable countries to study in. 
                                For instance, international students can pay between R 28,950 and R 108,200 on tuition per annum for a bachelor’s degree course or post-graduate diplomas at our partner universities. <br />
                                <strong>Accommodation and living expenses.</strong> <br />
                                Our partner universities offer on campus as well as off campus accommodation. Student can pay between R 3,500 and R 16,500 per month on accommodation depending on the city and student’s life style.
                                When coming to food and transport and electricity, a student can spend (if student cooks at home) approximately R 2,500 per month. 
                                The overall amount can go up or down based on student’s lifestyle and spending habits. Most of the off-campus accommodation are within a walking distance from the universities.
                                The South African currency is called rand (ZAR or R). At the time this information was published 1 US Dollar equals R 15,12 South African Rand.

                                Like in most countries, international students are required to apply for and obtain a student visa in order to study in South Africa. Students can apply for student/study visa at the South African High Commission, Embassy, Consulate or Trade Mission in their country of residence or nearest country that provides the required service. The student visa application process can take up-to six weeks, therefore students are advised to apply as early as possible, soon after receiving university ad mission letter and other supporting documents for study visa application.
