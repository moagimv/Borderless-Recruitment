                                Studying in the UK is generally cheaper than studying at equally ranked universities in the United States. International undergraduate tuition fees differ considerably, starting at around £10,000 (~US$14,130) and going up to £38,000 (~US$53,700) or more for medical degrees.</br>
                                <strong>Living expenses</strong> <br />
                                Just like in any other country of the world, even the UK has its most expensive parts of the country as well as its most affordable ones. For instance living in London costs more than any other city in the UK which makes it difficult to set a cost of living in stone. Just to have an idea, the average weekly budget including rent should be approximately £240.89 ($317.92 USD) for a student living in UK. However you can certainly live off of less/more than that depending on the flat you are renting, with an average of £12,000/$15,000 USD per year (excluding tuition fees).
