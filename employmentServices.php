                        <p>
                            In many countries that we recruit for, foreign candidates are required to take up some tests or register with the professional councils in those countries before they can be employed. For example; to work as a Nurse or Midwife in the UK one must register with Nursing & Midwifery Council (NMC), to work as a Teacher in New Zealand one has to register with the New Zealand Teaching Council etc.

                        <p>
                            Overseas work is not for everyone, you need to be international about it, develop certain skills and mind-set in order to find a job and grow your career in a foreign country. You must have a will to learn the language and culture of the country you want to work in. The following skills will come handy when looking for a job in a foreign country. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Flexibility</li>
                                <li>Sensitivity (to other cultures)</li>
                                <li>Adaptability</li>
                                <li>Risk-taking (calculated risk)</li>
                                <li>Cooperative</li>
