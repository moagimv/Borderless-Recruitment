                        <h3>CV Compilation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your CV is the only document that employers will form an opinion about your suitability for the position before they meet you. How you construct it will determine whether you will be invited for interview or not. Make sure your CV stands out from the rest. It must catch the employer’s attention.
                            <br /><br />
                            When compiling CV bear in mind that there are many candidates applying for the same job you are applying for, therefore some employers might not have enough time to read through long pages of CVs. Make is short, clean and eliminate unnecessary details. 
                            <br /><br />
                            We assist job-seekers to compile their CVs using latest CV techniques based on industry standards.

                        <h3>Qualifications Evaluation with SAQA or USAF</h3>
                        <p>
                            People who want to study or work in South Africa are required by law to evaluate their foreign qualifications with either South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) or Universities South Africa (USAF) formerly known as HESA. 
                            <br /><br />
                            Before embarking on the evaluation process, we are advising our clients to first confirm with the university or institution they want to study at about the evaluation they should apply for because some institutions prefer SAQA evaluation while others use USAF evaluation to make the admission decision.
                            <br /><br />
                            For many, it is challenging to apply for evaluation in South Africa while they are still in their home country, this is where Borderless Recruitment comes in. 
                            <br /><br />
                            We have made this process less tedious for our clients. 
                            <br /><br />
                            We assist our clients with application process, we make follow-ups and when the certificate is ready for collection we make arrangements for it to be send back to them at a minimal fee. In this way they avoid the stress of travelling to Pretoria - South Africa for the evaluation your qualifications. Everything is done while you sitting back home, let us do the runaround for you. 
                            <br /><br />

                        <p>
                            In many countries that we recruit for, foreign candidates are required to take up some tests or register with the professional councils in those countries before they can be employed. For example; to work as a Nurse or Midwife in the UK one must register with Nursing & Midwifery Council (NMC), to work as a Teacher in New Zealand one has to register with the New Zealand Teaching Council etc.
