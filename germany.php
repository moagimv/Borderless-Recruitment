                                The low cost on tuition from our partner university in Germany alleviates a great financial burden for you. 
                                To study at our partner university in Germany will cost you approximately €349 per month for a bachelor degree. 
                                However the online courses are far cheaper with an estimate of between €75 and €117 depending on the study option you would choose. 
                                The Masters programs cost approximately <br /> 
                                <strong>Living expenses</strong> <br />
                                Germany is relatively inexpensive country to live in as a student, however the cost of living expenses depends on the location and the type of accommodation a student chooses. 
                                For instance a one bedroom apartment in Berlin costs around €700 per month and the price for a meal may vary between €8 to €14 euros at some restaurant.
                                <br /><br />
                                When coming to transport, most students in the European countries use the bicycles to move around. 
                                While this is regarded as the most affordable means of transport when moving from a destination to another especially in overcrowded cities, students can also use buses at a cost of €70 per month.
