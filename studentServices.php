                        <h3>Scholarships, Grants and Study Loans</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is generally believed that international education is expensive, hence most academic institutions offer scholarships or grants to ease the tuition burden on students.
                            <br /><br />
                            Most universities that we recruit students for offer scholarship opportunities with terms and conditions, some are fully funded scholarships while others are partial scholarships or grants.
                            <br /><br />
                            We provide guidance on how to apply for scholarships, in some instances assisting students with writing the motivation letters for scholarships applications. For South African students there are companies offering study loans which come with terms and conditions. We are able to facilitate the study loan application process provided the student has the university admission letter and proof that someone will be able to repay the loan while the student is studying (terms and conditions apply)
