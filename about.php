                        <strong>Borderless Recruitment for Students</strong> <br /> 
                        Borderless Recruitment started its journey back in 2013 as a company that was recruiting foreign students who wanted to study in South Africa. The company initially 
                        focused on the students within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region where recruitment was done for IIEMSA (formerly known as Monash South Africa) 
                        and Inscape Education Group at the time, both South African based institutions of higher learning. 
                        <br /><br />
                        As Borderless Recruitment grows by leaps and bounds we have expanded our student recruitment services to the universities in Europe, Middle East and North America. 
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Guiding your every step in international study </strong><br />
                        At Borderless Recruitment we have gained valuable experience in providing students with post-school overseas study opportunities. Not only are we assisting students with study applications process, 
                        we also provide advice and guidance about study visa, accommodation and health cover. In some instances where students are required to submit motivation letters and CVs, Borderless Recruitment assists 
                        students on how to compile professional motivation letters.
                        <br /><br />
